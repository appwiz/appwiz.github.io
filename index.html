    <p>My background is in complex enterprise distributed systems. I've built teams from the ground up that have delivered, shipped, and operate best-in-class services in highly distributed environments at significant scale.</p>
    <p>I love sharing knowledge. Some of my public writing and speaking engagements are listed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVmsEsBKnL8">AWS re:Invent 2016: Enhance Your Mobile Apps with AI Using Amazon Lex</a></strong><p>Amazon Echo and Alexa have shown that voice interfaces provide significant benefits to users – interactions are easy, fast, and context-driven. In this hands-on session, you’ll see how to add compelling voice and chat interfaces to your mobile apps, using Amazon Lex for processing conversations and triggering corresponding actions in your backend systems, all without having to manage any infrastructure. You’ll leave knowing how to build apps that can "Find me a nearby hotel" or "Reorder supplies for the copier".</p></li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/announcing-the-aws-sdk-for-react-native/" />Announcing the AWS SDK for React Native</a></strong><p>Announcing the developer preview of the AWS SDK for React Native with support for Amazon S3 to store user data, including photos and videos, in the cloud, Amazon DynamoDB to store data into a NoSQL database, AWS Lambda to run serverless code in the cloud without the need for backend infrastructure, and Amazon SNS to send and receive push notifications. The SDK core uses Amazon Cognito Identity as the authentication provider to comply with best practices for mobile app development.</p></li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1D8PM9kdsI">AWS Webinars: Automate Your App Tests with Appium and AWS Device Farm</a></strong><p>AWS Device Farm enables developers to deliver higher quality iOS, Android and web apps by testing them against real phones and tablets in the AWS Cloud. Join us for a step-by-step tutorial that focuses on how to write tests using Appium test framework, and write them in such a way that they can be executed locally on an emulator/simulator/test device, and then run on 100s of devices in the cloud.</p></li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ses/using-iis-smtp-on-windows-20082012-with-amazon-ses/">Using IIS SMTP on Windows 2008/2012 with Amazon SES</a></strong><p>A natural extension for customers using Windows Server 2012 on AWS is to use Amazon SES for sending email. This post shows you how to configure the IIS SMTP service that is included with Windows to send email through Amazon SES. You can use the same configuration on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2.</p></li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xncKCdI_0">AWS re:Invent 2012: Using Amazon Simple Email Service</a></strong><p>If you're already building your website or application on AWS, using Amazon SES is a quick and cost-effective way to send your email. This session will talk about what Amazon SES is and why you would want to use it. Then we will dig into the most common ways our customers use Amazon SES with their current systems and give you the tools you need to do the same.</p></li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ses/amazon-ses-smtp-recommendations/">Amazon SES SMTP Recommendations</a></strong><p>Amazon SES provides a native SMTP interface, so that you can use a wide variety of SMTP-enabled programming languages and software packages to send email through Amazon SES. More information is available in the Amazon SES Developer Guide. In this post, we would like to provide you with three recommendations that will improve your SMTP sending.</p></li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ses/using-microsoft-sql-server-2008-r2-with-amazon-ses/">Using Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 with Amazon SES</a></strong><p>This post will help you configure Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 to send email through Amazon SES. The instructions apply if you are running SQL Server in Amazon EC2 or hosted elsewhere. This post assumes you are running on Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and SQL Server Management Studio is installed. If you need installation instructions, please refer to the Microsoft SQL Server documentation. The instructions may vary slightly if SQL Server Database Mail profiles or accounts are already set up.</p></li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ses/handling-bounces-and-complaints/">Handling Bounces and Complaints</a></strong><p>As you may have seen in Jeff Barr’s blog post or in an announcement, Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) now provides bounce and complaint notifications via Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). You can refer to the Amazon SES Developer Guide or Jeff’s post to learn how to set up this feature. In this post, we will show you how you might manage your email list using the information you get in the Amazon SNS notifications.</p></li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ses/getting-started-with-amazon-ses-and-net/">Getting Started with Amazon SES and .NET</a></strong><p>This post will help get you started using Amazon SES from .NET applications.
