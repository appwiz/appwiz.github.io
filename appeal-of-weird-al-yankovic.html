            <p><em>Original article is at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/magazine/weird-al-yankovic.html" aria-label="The Weirdly Enduring Appeal of Weird Al Yankovic (opens in new window)">The Weirdly Enduring Appeal of Weird Al Yankovic</a></em></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Weird Al Yankovic, the comedic musician known for his parodies of popular songs, has remained relevant and popular for over 40 years. He has amassed a large and dedicated fan base who appreciate his humor, creativity, and musical talent. Sam Anderson, the author of the article, delves into the life and career of Weird Al to understand the secret behind his enduring appeal.</p>
                <p>Born Alfred Matthew Yankovic in 1959, Weird Al grew up in a loving and supportive household. His parents encouraged his musical pursuits, buying him an accordion when he was just six years old. He was inspired by an eclectic mix of artists, including Spike Jones, Tom Lehrer, and Allan Sherman, who all combined humor and music. During his teenage years, he began recording parody songs in his bedroom and sending them to Dr. Demento, a radio DJ who played novelty songs. This led to his first radio hit, "My Bologna," a parody of The Knack's "My Sharona."</p>
                <p>Yankovic's career took off in the 1980s when he gained fame for his parodies of Michael Jackson's "Beat It" and Madonna's "Like a Virgin." His rise to prominence coincided with the advent of MTV, which helped to popularize his humorous music videos. While many of his contemporaries have faded into obscurity, Yankovic has managed to stay relevant by constantly adapting to new musical trends and styles.</p>
                <p>Part of Weird Al's appeal lies in his ability to satirize the zeitgeist of each era. He has parodied nearly every major musical artist and genre, from pop and rock to rap and country. His parodies often reveal deeper truths about the songs they mock, poking fun at the clich√©s and absurdities of popular music. His clever lyrics and catchy tunes have earned him numerous accolades, including five Grammy Awards.</p>
                <p>Weird Al's success can also be attributed to his relentless work ethic and meticulous attention to detail. He is known for his extensive research into the songs he parodies, studying their structures, chord progressions, and lyrical patterns. Yankovic also goes to great lengths to secure permission from the original artists, even though it is not legally required. Many artists consider it an honor to be parodied by Weird Al, with some even claiming that his versions are better than their own.</p>
                <p>Despite his accomplishments, Yankovic remains humble and down-to-earth. He is a devoted husband and father who prioritizes spending time with his family. He maintains a clean and family-friendly image, avoiding profanity and explicit content in his songs. This has earned him a diverse fan base that spans multiple generations.</p>
                <p>Weird Al's longevity in the entertainment industry is a testament to his unique blend of humor, creativity, and musicianship. In an era dominated by cynicism and irony, his sincere and lighthearted approach to comedy provides a refreshing alternative. As Sam Anderson concludes, Weird Al Yankovic's enduring appeal lies in his ability to make us laugh at ourselves and the world around us while reminding us of the joys and absurdities of life.</p>
